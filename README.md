# What am I (Jonah Senzel) doing? 

This site is an experiment in publicisizing what I'm working on, deadlines, etc. It's similar to my previous site [deadlines](deadlines.crd.co) but with the goal of being even more dead simple and easier for me to edit (it's just a markdown page on github pages). For ease of writing the site will read top down most recent
